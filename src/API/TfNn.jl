Atrous convolution (a.k.a. convolution with holes or dilated convolution).

  Computes a 2-D atrous convolution, also known as convolution with holes or
  dilated convolution, given 4-D `value` and `filters` tensors. If the `rate`
  parameter is equal to one, it performs regular 2-D convolution. If the `rate`
  parameter is greater than one, it performs convolution with holes, sampling
  the input values every `rate` pixels in the `height` and `width` dimensions.
  This is equivalent to convolving the input with a set of upsampled filters,
  produced by inserting `rate - 1` zeros between two consecutive values of the
  filters along the `height` and `width` dimensions, hence the name atrous
  convolution or convolution with holes (the French word trous means holes in
  English).

  More specifically:

      output[b, i, j, k] = sum_{di, dj, q} filters[di, dj, q, k] *
            value[b, i + rate * di, j + rate * dj, q]

  Atrous convolution allows us to explicitly control how densely to compute
  feature responses in fully convolutional networks. Used in conjunction with
  bilinear interpolation, it offers an alternative to `conv2d_transpose` in
  dense prediction tasks such as semantic image segmentation, optical flow
  computation, or depth estimation. It also allows us to effectively enlarge
  the field of view of filters without increasing the number of parameters or
  the amount of computation.

  For a description of atrous convolution and how it can be used for dense
  feature extraction, please see: (Semantic Image Segmentation with Deep
  Convolutional Nets and Fully Connected CRFs)[http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7062].
  The same operation is investigated further in (Multi-Scale Context Aggregation
  by Dilated Convolutions)[http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.07122]. Previous works
  that effectively use atrous convolution in different ways are, among others,
  (OverFeat: Integrated Recognition, Localization and Detection using
  Convolutional Networks) [http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6229] and (Fast Image
  Scanning with Deep Max-Pooling Convolutional Neural Networks)
  [http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.1700]. Atrous convolution is also closely related
  to the so-called noble identities in multi-rate signal processing.

  There are many different ways to implement atrous convolution (see the refs
  above). The implementation here reduces

      atrous_conv2d(value, filters, rate, padding=padding)

  to the following three operations:

      paddings = ...
      net = space_to_batch(value, paddings, block_size=rate)
      net = conv2d(net, filters, strides=[1, 1, 1, 1], padding="VALID")
      crops = ...
      net = batch_to_space(net, crops, block_size=rate)

  Advanced usage. Note the following optimization: A sequence of `atrous_conv2d`
  operations with identical `rate` parameters, 'SAME' `padding`, and filters
  with odd heights/ widths:

      net = atrous_conv2d(net, filters1, rate, padding="SAME")
      net = atrous_conv2d(net, filters2, rate, padding="SAME")
      ...
      net = atrous_conv2d(net, filtersK, rate, padding="SAME")

  can be equivalently performed cheaper in terms of computation and memory as:

      pad = ...  # padding so that the input dims are multiples of rate
      net = space_to_batch(net, paddings=pad, block_size=rate)
      net = conv2d(net, filters1, strides=[1, 1, 1, 1], padding="SAME")
      net = conv2d(net, filters2, strides=[1, 1, 1, 1], padding="SAME")
      ...
      net = conv2d(net, filtersK, strides=[1, 1, 1, 1], padding="SAME")
      net = batch_to_space(net, crops=pad, block_size=rate)

  because a pair of consecutive `space_to_batch` and `batch_to_space` ops with
  the same `block_size` cancel out when their respective `paddings` and `crops`
  inputs are identical.

  Args:
    value: A 4-D `Tensor` of type `float`. It needs to be in the default "NHWC"
      format. Its shape is `[batch, in_height, in_width, in_channels]`.
    filters: A 4-D `Tensor` with the same type as `value` and shape
      `[filter_height, filter_width, in_channels, out_channels]`. `filters`'
      `in_channels` dimension must match that of `value`. Atrous convolution is
      equivalent to standard convolution with upsampled filters with effective
      height `filter_height + (filter_height - 1) * (rate - 1)` and effective
      width `filter_width + (filter_width - 1) * (rate - 1)`, produced by
      inserting `rate - 1` zeros along consecutive elements across the
      `filters`' spatial dimensions.
    rate: A positive int32. The stride with which we sample input values across
      the `height` and `width` dimensions. Equivalently, the rate by which we
      upsample the filter values by inserting zeros across the `height` and
      `width` dimensions. In the literature, the same parameter is sometimes
      called `input stride` or `dilation`.
    padding: A string, either `'VALID'` or `'SAME'`. The padding algorithm.
    name: Optional name for the returned tensor.

  Returns:
    A `Tensor` with the same type as `value`.

  Raises:
    ValueError: If input/output depth does not match `filters`' shape, or if
      padding is other than `'VALID'` or `'SAME'`.

  \\(\frac{\gamma(x-\mu)}{\sigma}+\beta\\)

  `mean`, `variance`, `offset` and `scale` are all expected to be of one of two

      normalized over (the 'depth' dimension(s)), and dimension 1 for the

Compute the position ids in `sampled_candidates` matching `true_classes`.

  In Candidate Sampling, this operation facilitates virtually removing
  sampled classes which happen to match target classes.  This is done
  in Sampled Softmax and Sampled Logistic.

  See our [Candidate Sampling Algorithms
  Reference](http://www.tensorflow.org/extras/candidate_sampling.pdf).

  We presuppose that the `sampled_candidates` are unique.

  We call it an 'accidental hit' when one of the target classes
  matches one of the sampled classes.  This operation reports
  accidental hits as triples `(index, id, weight)`, where `index`
  represents the row number in `true_classes`, `id` represents the
  position in `sampled_candidates`, and weight is `-FLOAT_MAX`.

  The result of this op should be passed through a `sparse_to_dense`
  operation, then added to the logits of the sampled classes. This
  removes the contradictory effect of accidentally sampling the true
  target classes as noise classes for the same example.

Creates a recurrent neural network specified by RNNCell "cell".

  This function is functionally identical to the function `rnn` above, but
  performs fully dynamic unrolling of `inputs`.

  Unlike `rnn`, the input `inputs` is not a Python list of `Tensors`.  Instead,
  it is a single `Tensor` where the maximum time is either the first or second
  dimension (see the parameter `time_major`).  The corresponding output is
  a single `Tensor` having the same number of time steps and batch size.

  The parameter `sequence_length` is required and dynamic calculation is
  automatically performed.

  Args:
    cell: An instance of RNNCell.
    inputs: The RNN inputs.
      If time_major == False (default), this must be a tensor of shape:
        `[batch_size, max_time, input_size]`.
      If time_major == True, this must be a tensor of shape:
        `[max_time, batch_size, input_size]`.
    sequence_length: (optional) An int32/int64 vector sized `[batch_size]`.
    initial_state: (optional) An initial state for the RNN.  This must be
      a tensor of appropriate type and shape `[batch_size x cell.state_size]`.
    dtype: (optional) The data type for the initial state.  Required if
      initial_state is not provided.
    parallel_iterations: (Default: 32).  The number of iterations to run in
      parallel.  Those operations which do not have any temporal dependency
      and can be run in parallel, will be.  This parameter trades off
      time for space.  Values >> 1 use more memory but take less time,
      while smaller values use less memory but computations take longer.
    swap_memory: Swap the tensors produced in forward inference but needed
      for back prop from GPU to CPU.
    time_major: The shape format of the `inputs` and `outputs` Tensors.
      If true, these `Tensors` must be shaped `[max_time, batch_size, depth]`.
      If false, these `Tensors` must be shaped `[batch_size, max_time, depth]`.
      Using time_major = True is a bit more efficient because it avoids
      transposes at the beginning and end of the RNN calculation.  However,
      most TensorFlow data is batch-major, so by default this function
      accepts input and emits output in batch-major form.

Looks up `ids` in a list of embedding tensors.

  This function is used to perform parallel lookups on the list of
  tensors in `params`.  It is a generalization of
  [`tf.gather()`](../../api_docs/python/array_ops.md#gather), where `params` is
  interpreted as a partition of a larger embedding tensor.

  If `len(params) > 1`, each element `id` of `ids` is partitioned between
  the elements of `params` according to the `partition_strategy`.
  In all strategies, if the id space does not evenly divide the number of
  partitions, each of the first `(max_id + 1) % len(params)` partitions will
  be assigned one more id.

  If `partition_strategy` is `"mod"`, we assign each id to partition
  `p = id % len(params)`. For instance,
  13 ids are split across 5 partitions as:
  `[[0, 5, 10], [1, 6, 11], [2, 7, 12], [3, 8], [4, 9]]`

  If `partition_strategy` is `"div"`, we assign ids to partitions in a
  contiguous manner. In this case, 13 ids are split across 5 partitions as:
  `[[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8], [9, 10], [11, 12]]`

  The results of the lookup are concatenated into a dense
  tensor. The returned tensor has shape `shape(ids) + shape(params)[1:]`.

  Args:
    params: A list of tensors with the same type and which can be concatenated

      up in `params`.
    partition_strategy: A string specifying the partitioning strategy, relevant

      is `"mod"`.
    name: A name for the operation (optional).

Computes embeddings for the given ids and weights.

  This op assumes that there is at least one id for each row in the dense tensor

  all the indices of sp_ids are in canonical row-major order.

  It also assumes that all id values lie in the range [0, p0), where p0
  is the sum of the size of params along dimension 0.

  Args:
    params: A single tensor representing the complete embedding tensor,
      or a list of P tensors all of same shape except for the first dimension,
      representing sharded embedding tensors.
    sp_ids: N x M SparseTensor of int64 ids (typically from FeatureValueToId),
      where N is typically batch size and M is arbitrary.
    sp_weights: either a SparseTensor of float / double weights, or None to
      indicate all weights should be taken to be 1. If specified, sp_weights
      must have exactly the same shape and indices as sp_ids.
    partition_strategy: A string specifying the partitioning strategy, relevant
      if `len(params) > 1`. Currently `"div"` and `"mod"` are supported. Default
      is `"mod"`. See `tf.nn.embedding_lookup` for more details.
    name: Optional name for the op.
    combiner: A string specifying the reduction op. Currently "mean", "sqrtn"
      and "sum" are supported.
      "sum" computes the weighted sum of the embedding results for each row.
      "mean" is the weighted sum divided by the total weight.
      "sqrtn" is the weighted sum divided by the square root of the sum of the
      squares of the weights.

  Returns:
    A dense tensor representing the combined embeddings for the
    sparse ids. For each row in the dense tensor represented by sp_ids, the op
    looks up the embeddings for all ids in that row, multiplies them by the

Samples a set of classes using the provided (fixed) base distribution.

  This operation randomly samples a tensor of sampled classes
  (`sampled_candidates`) from the range of integers `[0, range_max]`.

  The elements of `sampled_candidates` are drawn without replacement
  (if `unique=True`) or with replacement (if `unique=False`) from
  the base distribution.

  The base distribution is read from a file or passed in as an
  in-memory array. There is also an option to skew the distribution by
  applying a distortion power to the weights.

  In addition, this operation returns tensors `true_expected_count`
  and `sampled_expected_count` representing the number of times each
  of the target classes (`true_classes`) and the sampled
  classes (`sampled_candidates`) is expected to occur in an average
  tensor of sampled classes.  These values correspond to `Q(y|x)`
  defined in [this
  document](http://www.tensorflow.org/extras/candidate_sampling.pdf).
  If `unique=True`, then these are post-rejection probabilities and we
  compute them approximately.

  Args:
    true_classes: A `Tensor` of type `int64` and shape `[batch_size,
      num_true]`. The target classes.
    num_true: An `int`.  The number of target classes per training example.
    num_sampled: An `int`.  The number of classes to randomly sample per batch.
    unique: A `bool`. Determines whether all sampled classes in a batch are
      unique.
    range_max: An `int`. The number of possible classes.
    vocab_file: Each valid line in this file (which should have a CSV-like
      format) corresponds to a valid word ID. IDs are in sequential order,
      starting from num_reserved_ids. The last entry in each line is expected
      to be a value corresponding to the count or relative probability. Exactly
      one of `vocab_file` and `unigrams` needs to be passed to this operation.
    distortion: The distortion is used to skew the unigram probability
      distribution.  Each weight is first raised to the distortion's power
      before adding to the internal unigram distribution. As a result,
      `distortion = 1.0` gives regular unigram sampling (as defined by the vocab
      file), and `distortion = 0.0` gives a uniform distribution.
    num_reserved_ids: Optionally some reserved IDs can be added in the range
      `[0, num_reserved_ids]` by the users. One use case is that a special
      unknown word token is used as ID 0. These IDs will have a sampling
      probability of 0.
    num_shards: A sampler can be used to sample from a subset of the original
      range in order to speed up the whole computation through parallelism. This
      parameter (together with `shard`) indicates the number of partitions that
      are being used in the overall computation.
    shard: A sampler can be used to sample from a subset of the original range
      in order to speed up the whole computation through parallelism. This
      parameter (together with `num_shards`) indicates the particular partition
      number of the operation, when partitioning is being used.

Samples a set of classes from a distribution learned during training.

  This operation randomly samples a tensor of sampled classes
  (`sampled_candidates`) from the range of integers `[0, range_max]`.

  The elements of `sampled_candidates` are drawn without replacement
  (if `unique=True`) or with replacement (if `unique=False`) from
  the base distribution.

  The base distribution for this operation is constructed on the fly
  during training.  It is a unigram distribution over the target
  classes seen so far during training.  Every integer in `[0, range_max]`
  begins with a weight of 1, and is incremented by 1 each time it is
  seen as a target class.  The base distribution is not saved to checkpoints,
  so it is reset when the model is reloaded.

  In addition, this operation returns tensors `true_expected_count`
  and `sampled_expected_count` representing the number of times each
  of the target classes (`true_classes`) and the sampled
  classes (`sampled_candidates`) is expected to occur in an average
  tensor of sampled classes.  These values correspond to `Q(y|x)`
  defined in [this
  document](http://www.tensorflow.org/extras/candidate_sampling.pdf).
  If `unique=True`, then these are post-rejection probabilities and we
  compute them approximately.

  Args:

2-D convolution with separable filters.

  Performs a depthwise convolution that acts separately on channels followed by
  a pointwise convolution that mixes channels.  Note that this is separability
  between dimensions `[1, 2]` and `3`, not spatial separability between
  dimensions `1` and `2`.

  In detail,

      output[b, i, j, k] = sum_{di, dj, q, r]

  `strides` controls the strides for the depthwise convolution only, since
  the pointwise convolution has implicit strides of `[1, 1, 1, 1]`.  Must have
  `strides[0] = strides[3] = 1`.  For the most common case of the same
  horizontal and vertical strides, `strides = [1, stride, stride, 1]`.

  Args:
    input: 4-D `Tensor` with shape `[batch, in_height, in_width, in_channels]`.
    depthwise_filter: 4-D `Tensor` with shape
      `[filter_height, filter_width, in_channels, channel_multiplier]`.
      Contains `in_channels` convolutional filters of depth 1.
    pointwise_filter: 4-D `Tensor` with shape
      `[1, 1, channel_multiplier * in_channels, out_channels]`.  Pointwise
      filter to mix channels after `depthwise_filter` has convolved spatially.
    strides: 1-D of size 4.  The strides for the depthwise convolution for
      each dimension of `input`.
    padding: A string, either `'VALID'` or `'SAME'`.  The padding algorithm.
