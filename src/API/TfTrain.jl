Creates a `Saver`.

    The constructor adds ops to save and restore variables.

    `var_list` specifies the variables that will be saved and restored. It can
    be passed as a `dict` or a list:

    * A `dict` of names to variables: The keys are the names that will be
      used to save or restore the variables in the checkpoint files.
    * A list of variables: The variables will be keyed with their op name in
      the checkpoint files.

    For example:

    ```python
    v1 = tf.Variable(..., name='v1')
    v2 = tf.Variable(..., name='v2')

    # Pass the variables as a dict:
    saver = tf.train.Saver({'v1': v1, 'v2': v2})

    # Or pass them as a list.
    saver = tf.train.Saver([v1, v2])
    # Passing a list is equivalent to passing a dict with the variable op names
    # as keys:
    saver = tf.train.Saver({v.op.name: v for v in [v1, v2]})
    ```

    The optional `reshape` argument, if `True`, allows restoring a variable from
    a save file where the variable had a different shape, but the same number
    of elements and type.  This is useful if you have reshaped a variable and
    want to reload it from an older checkpoint.

    The optional `sharded` argument, if `True`, instructs the saver to shard
    checkpoints per device.

    Args:
      var_list: A list of `Variable` objects or a dictionary mapping names to
        variables.  If `None`, defaults to the list of all variables.
      reshape: If `True`, allows restoring parameters from a checkpoint
        where the variables have a different shape.
      sharded: If `True`, shard the checkpoints, one per device.
      max_to_keep: Maximum number of recent checkpoints to keep.
        Defaults to 5.

        Defaults to 10,000 hours.
      name: String.  Optional name to use as a prefix when adding operations.
      restore_sequentially: A `Bool`, which if true, causes restore of different
        variables to happen sequentially within each device.  This can lower
        memory usage when restoring very large models.
      saver_def: Optional `SaverDef` proto to use instead of running the
        builder. This is only useful for specialty code that wants to recreate
        a `Saver` object for a previously built `Graph` that had a `Saver`.

Creates a `SummaryWriter` and an event file.

    On construction the summary writer creates a new event file in `logdir`.
    This event file will contain `Event` protocol buffers constructed when you
    call one of the following functions: `add_summary()`, `add_session_log()`,
    `add_event()`, or `add_graph()`.

    If you pass a `Graph` to the constructor it is added to
    the event file. (This is equivalent to calling `add_graph()` later).

    TensorBoard will pick the graph from the file and display it graphically so
    you can interactively explore the graph you built. You will usually pass

        automatically unless you pass a value for `init_fn`, see below.
      init_feed_dict: A dictionary that maps `Tensor` objects to feed values.
        This feed dictionary will be used when `init_op` is evaluated.
      local_init_op: `Operation`. Used by all supervisors to run initializations
        that should run for every new supervisor instance. By default these
        are table initializers and initializers for local variables.
        If `None`, no further per supervisor-instance initialization is
        done automatically.
      logdir: A string.  Optional path to a directory where to checkpoint the

        Used by chief supervisors if a `logdir` was specified.  Defaults to the
        operation returned from merge_all_summaries().  If `None`, summaries are
        not computed automatically.

        If `None`, the model is not saved automatically.
      global_step: An integer Tensor of size 1 that counts steps.  The value
        from 'global_step' is used in summaries and checkpoint filenames.
        Default to the op named 'global_step' in the graph if it exists, is of
        rank 1, size 1, and of type tf.int32 ot tf.int64.  If `None` the global
        step is not recorded in summaries and checkpoint files.  Used by chief
        supervisors if a `logdir` was specified.
      save_summaries_secs: Number of seconds between the computation of
        summaries for the event log.  Defaults to 120 seconds.  Pass 0 to
        disable summaries.
      save_model_secs: Number of seconds between the creation of model
        checkpoints.  Defaults to 600 seconds.  Pass 0 to disable checkpoints.
      recovery_wait_secs: Number of seconds between checks that the model
        is ready.  Used by supervisors when waiting for a chief supervisor
        to initialize or restore the model.  Defaults to 30 seconds.
      stop_grace_secs: Grace period, in seconds, given to running threads to
        stop when `stop()` is called.  Defaults to 120 seconds.
      checkpoint_basename: The basename for checkpoint saving.
      session_manager: `SessionManager`, which manages Session creation and
        recovery. If it is `None`, a default `SessionManager` will be created
        with the set of arguments passed in for backwards compatibility.
      summary_writer: `SummaryWriter` to use or `USE_DEFAULT`.  Can be `None`
        to indicate that no summaries should be written.
      init_fn: Optional callable used to initialize the model. Called
        after the optional `init_op` is called.  The callable must accept one
        argument, the session being initialized.

Creates batches of tensors in `tensor_list`.

  This function is implemented using a queue. A `QueueRunner` for the
  queue is added to the current `Graph`'s `QUEUE_RUNNER` collection.

  If `enqueue_many` is `False`, `tensor_list` is assumed to represent a
  single example.  An input tensor with shape `[x, y, z]` will be output
  as a tensor with shape `[batch_size, x, y, z]`.

  If `enqueue_many` is `True`, `tensor_list` is assumed to represent a
  batch of examples, where the first dimension is indexed by example,
  and all members of `tensor_list` should have the same size in the
  first dimension.  If an input tensor has shape `[*, x, y, z]`, the
  output will have shape `[batch_size, x, y, z]`.  The `capacity` argument
  controls the how long the prefetching is allowed to grow the queues.

  The returned operation is a dequeue operation and will throw
  `tf.errors.OutOfRangeError` if the input queue is exhausted. If this
  operation is feeding another input queue, its queue runner will catch
  this exception, however, if this operation is used in your main thread
  you are responsible for catching this yourself.

  *N.B.:* If `dynamic_pad` is `False`, you must ensure that either
  (i) the `shapes` argument is passed, or (ii) all of the tensors in

  raised if neither of these conditions holds.

  If `dynamic_pad` is `True`, it is sufficient that the *rank* of the
  tensors is known, but individual dimensions may have shape `None`.
  In this case, for each enqueue the dimensions with value `None`
  may have a variable length; upon dequeue, the output tensors will be padded

"""
Applies exponential decay to the learning rate.

  When training a model, it is often recommended to lower the learning rate as
  the training progresses.  This function applies an exponential decay function
  to a provided initial learning rate.  It requires a `global_step` value to
  compute the decayed learning rate.  You can just pass a TensorFlow variable
  that you increment at each training step.

  The function returns the decayed learning rate.  It is computed as:

  ```python
  decayed_learning_rate = learning_rate *
                          decay_rate ^ (global_step / decay_steps)
  ```

  If the argument `staircase` is `True`, then `global_step /decay_steps` is an
  integer division and the decayed learning rate follows a staircase function.

  Example: decay every 100000 steps with a base of 0.96:

  ```python
  ...
  global_step = tf.Variable(0, trainable=False)
  starter_learning_rate = 0.1
  learning_rate = tf.train.exponential_decay(starter_learning_rate, global_step,
                                             100000, 0.96, staircase=True)
  # Passing global_step to minimize() will increment it at each step.
  learning_step = (
      tf.GradientDescentOptimizer(learning_rate)
      .minimize(...my loss..., global_step=global_step)
  )
  ```

  Args:
    learning_rate: A scalar `float32` or `float64` `Tensor` or a
      Python number.  The initial learning rate.
    global_step: A scalar `int32` or `int64` `Tensor` or a Python number.
      Global step to use for the decay computation.  Must not be negative.
    decay_steps: A scalar `int32` or `int64` `Tensor` or a Python number.
      Must be positive.  See the decay computation above.
    decay_rate: A scalar `float32` or `float64` `Tensor` or a

  as a tensor with shape `[batch_size, x, y, z]`.

  If `enqueue_many` is `True`, `tensor_list` is assumed to represent a
  batch of examples, where the first dimension is indexed by example,
  and all members of `tensor_list` should have the same size in the
  first dimension.  If an input tensor has shape `[*, x, y, z]`, the
  output will have shape `[batch_size, x, y, z]`.

  The `capacity` argument controls the how long the prefetching is allowed to
  grow the queues.

  The returned operation is a dequeue operation and will throw
  `tf.errors.OutOfRangeError` if the input queue is exhausted. If this
  operation is feeding another input queue, its queue runner will catch
  this exception, however, if this operation is used in your main thread
  you are responsible for catching this yourself.

  For example:

  ```python
  # Creates batches of 32 images and 32 labels.
  image_batch, label_batch = tf.train.shuffle_batch(
        [single_image, single_label],
        batch_size=32,
        num_threads=4,
        capacity=50000,
        min_after_dequeue=10000)
  ```

  *N.B.:* You must ensure that either (i) the `shapes` argument is
  passed, or (ii) all of the tensors in `tensor_list` must have
  fully-defined shapes. `ValueError` will be raised if neither of
  these conditions holds.

  Args:
    tensor_list: The list of tensors to enqueue.
    batch_size: The new batch size pulled from the queue.
    capacity: An integer. The maximum number of elements in the queue.
    min_after_dequeue: Minimum number elements in the queue after a
      dequeue, used to ensure a level of mixing of elements.
    num_threads: The number of threads enqueuing `tensor_list`.
    seed: Seed for the random shuffling within the queue.
    enqueue_many: Whether each tensor in `tensor_list` is a single example.
    shapes: (Optional) The shapes for each example.  Defaults to the

    shared_name: (Optional) If set, this queue will be shared under the given
      name across multiple sessions.
    name: (Optional) A name for the operations.

  Returns:
    A list of tensors with the same number and types as `tensor_list`.

  Raises:
    ValueError: If the `shapes` are not specified, and cannot be
      inferred from the elements of `tensor_list`.

Create batches by randomly shuffling tensors.

  This version enqueues a different list of tensors in different threads.
  It adds the following to the current `Graph`:

  * A shuffling queue into which tensors from `tensor_list_list` are enqueued.
  * A `dequeue_many` operation to create batches from the queue.
  * A `QueueRunner` to `QUEUE_RUNNER` collection, to enqueue the tensors
    from `tensor_list_list`.

  `len(tensor_list_list)` threads will be started, with thread `i` enqueuing
  the tensors from `tensor_list_list[i]`. `tensor_list_list[i1][j]` must match
  `tensor_list_list[i2][j]` in type and shape, except in the first dimension if
  `enqueue_many` is true.

  If `enqueue_many` is `False`, each `tensor_list_list[i]` is assumed
  to represent a single example.  An input tensor with shape `[x, y,
  z]` will be output as a tensor with shape `[batch_size, x, y, z]`.
